<h1>📄 Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>App Name:</strong> BigBang OT5 Fan Moments</p>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 29, 2026</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p><strong>Account Information</strong><br>
This app does not allow users to create accounts.
We do not collect email addresses, passwords, phone numbers, or login credentials.
</p>

<p><strong>Personal Information</strong><br>
The developer does not directly collect personally identifiable information (PII).
</p>

<h2>2. Device or Other Identifiers</h2>
<p>
The app integrates third-party services (such as advertising SDKs).
These services may automatically collect device or other identifiers
(for example, Advertising ID).
</p>
<p>
This data may be used for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Advertising</li>
    <li>Analytics</li>
    <li>Fraud prevention</li>
</ul>
<p>
The developer does not directly access, store, or control this data.
</p>

<h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
<p>
Information is used only to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Display advertisements</li>
    <li>Ensure app functionality</li>
    <li>Improve performance and stability</li>
</ul>
<p>
No user profiling or personal tracking is performed by the developer.
</p>

<h2>4. Advertisements</h2>
<p>
This app displays third-party banner and interstitial advertisements.
</p>
<p>
Advertising partners (such as Google AdMob) may collect and process data
according to their own privacy policies.
</p>
<p>
Users can reset or limit ad personalization through their device settings.
</p>

<h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
The developer does not sell, rent, or share personal data.
</p>
<p>
Non-personal data may be processed by third-party services strictly
for advertising and analytics purposes.
</p>

<h2>6. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
<p>
This app does not store user data on developer-controlled servers.
</p>
<p>
Because the app:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Does not support user accounts</li>
    <li>Does not store personal data externally</li>
</ul>
<p>
There is no manual data deletion request feature.
</p>
<p>
Any data collected by third-party services is retained and deleted
according to their respective privacy policies.
</p>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
